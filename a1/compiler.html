<h1>Compiling the PL0 compiler</h1>

<font color="blue">Sections in blue refer to the compilers used for
  assignments 2 and 3, so ignore the blue parts when doing tutorial 4 and assignment 1.</font>


<h2>Running the PL0 compiler under IntelliJ</h2>

<h3>Importing the Project</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Download the .zip file containing the compiler from the course web page
  <li>Unzip the assignment .zip file to create a directory containing the compiler
    as a IntelliJ project
  <li>Start IntelliJ Idea -- version 2018-3 (or later) is required to use the supplied
    run configurations
  <li>File > Open
  <li>Navigate to the unzipped directory containing the compiler and select the directory
  <li>Open
  <li>If there is a bar at the top of the code stating "Project SDJ is not defined" then select "Setup SDK"
    (on the right of the bar). That will display your available SDKs.
    Select one that is at least Java 1.8 (and Project language level 8) and select OK.
    [This is required if the SDK you are using is different to the one I'm using.]
</ul>

<h3>Run Configurations Provided</h3>

The compiler IntelliJ project comes with two run configurations.
<ul>
  <li>"PL0_RD" <font color="blue">("PL0_LALR")</font>
    runs the compiler on whatever file is currently displayed in IntelliJ.
    It is recommended that this be a PL0 file -- if it is a Java file the PL0 compiler
    will still attempt to parse it but many error messages will ensue as its not valid PL0.
    You may want to edit this configuration to change the program parameters,
    e.g. to add "-s" to turn off static checking (and everything beyond that)
    or add "-d" to turn on debugging output.
  <li>"Test_RD" <font color="blue">("Test_LALR")</font>
    runs the PL0 compiler on every test case and compares the output with that expected.
    Ticked test cases succeeded and crossed test cases failed.
</ul>

<!--
<h3>Run Configurations</h3>
Unlike Eclipse, IntelliJ does not have an option for using the selected filename as input to the run configuration.
The <code>Context Run</code> plugin gives this functionality.
<ul>
    <li>File > Settings > Plugins > Browse repositories > Context Run (install and restart intellij)
    <li>Run > Edit Configurations > Plus Button > ContextRun.
    <li>Select the main class using the drop down on the right (should be pl0.PL0_RD or pl0.PL0_LALR).
    <li>Put $FilePath$ into the program arguments (you can prefix that
  by options like "-s" and/or "-d" -- see below)
    <li>Select module in the classpath of module drop down (should be only be the one module)
    <li>Give the configuration a name like "Compile selected PL0 file"
    <li>Test it out by clicking on test-base0-abs.pl0 in the project window, selecting the configuration in the top configuration dropdown and hitting Run
</ul>
-->

<h3>Compiler options</h3>

If a compilation of a PL0 program is successful, 
the compiler normally runs the interpreter to execute the generated code.
However there are a number of compiler parameters that can change its
behaviour.
<ul>
    <li>Usage: java pl0.PL0_RD [-dsi<font color="blue">gevt</font>h] <i>filename.pl0</i></li>
    <li>  -d  =  turn debug messages on (verbose trace of parsing, etc.)
    <li>  -s  =  turn static checking off (useful for debugging the parser)</li>
    <li>  -i  =  turn interpretation off</li>
    <font color="blue">
        <li>  -g  =  turn code generation off</li>
        <li>  -e  =  turn code execution off</li>
        <li>  -v  =  output of generated code</li>
        <li>  -t  =  trace execution of generated code (verbose)</li>
    </font>
    <li>  -h  =  output this usage information</li>
    <li> <i>filename.pl0</i> file to be compiled.</li>
</ul>
<!--The compiler switches are also documented at the start of PL0_RD.java 
or <font color="blue"> PL0_LALR.java.</font>-->
<p>
  The <b>-d</b> option gives a blow-by-blow (very verbose) trace
  of the recursive descent parsing process (for assignment 1 compiler)
  or <font color="blue"> the shift-reduce parsing process
    (for assignment 2 and 3 compilers).</font>
  It also gives extra debugging output during static checking and interpretation or
  code generation.
<p>
  <font color="blue">The <b>-t</b> option is useful for debugging problems with the
  code your compiler generates; it gives a very verbose blow-by-blow
  trace of the execution of the code.</font>
<p>
  To debug the parsing, run the compiler with the "-s" option
  and perhaps "-d" to get the debugging output to see what it is doing.
<p>
To debug the static checker, run with "-i" and possibly "-d" as well.
<p>
  <font color="blue">To debug the code generation, run with just "-v" to see generated code,
    and if things go wrong at run time, try adding "-t" to get a very detailed trace of execution,
    instruction by instruction; this is where smaller programs will be easier.</font>

<h3>Test Programs</h3>

There is a suite of test PL0 programs within the
subdirectory <i>test-pgm</i>. 

When you run a program using the PL0_RD run configuration the output of the compiler appears in the
"Console" window (usually under the program).
<pre>
Compiling test-based-write1.pl0
Parsing complete
Static semantic analysis complete
Running ...
1

Terminated
No errors detected.

Process finished with exit code 0
</pre>
The line containing "1" is the output produced by this particular
(simple) PL0 program.


<h3>Syntax Highlighting</h3>
To enable PL0 syntax highlighting
<ul>
  <li>File > Import Settings</li>
  <li>Navigate to the unzipped directory and select pl0-syntax.jar and open and OK</li>
  <li>You'll need to restart IntelliJ
</ul>
<font color="blue">
To enable Java CUP syntax highlighting:
<ul>
  <li>File (IntelliJ Idea on Mac) > Settings (Preferences on Mac) > Plugins > Browse repositories > Cup support (install and restart IntelliJ)
</ul>
</font>

<h3>Using git</h3>
To enable git version control in IntelliJ:
<ul>
    <li>VCS > Enable Version Control Integration > Git > Ok
    <li>Select all the files > Right Click > Git > Add
    <li>VCS > Git > Commit File > Select all files (if not already selected) > Enter commit message and commit (don't select Commit and Push)
</ul>

<font color="blue">
<h3>Running CUP and JFlex to build parser and lexical analyser (scanner) Java source files</h3>

Run scripts <i>Run CUP</i> and <i>Run JFlex</i> are provided with the compilers using Java CUP
and JFLex to generate the parser and lexical analyser, respectively.
<p>
  The run script <i>PL0_LALR</i> automatically runs both Java CUP and JFlex
  but the errors messages for each of these only flash up in the console window for a short time.
  To see the messages from Java CUP or JFLex you can select the "Run CUP" or "Run JFlex" tabs
  in the console window of IntelliJ (at the bottom).
  Alternatively, you can run Java Cup and JFlex separately (see below) and check for errors,
  before running <i>PL0_LALR</i>.

<h4>Run CUP</h4>

<ul>
  <li>This script runs Java CUP on input file <i>PL0.cup</i> to produce <i>CUPParser.java</i> and <i>CUPToken.java</i>.
  <li>You need to rerun this script any time you change <i>PL0.cup</i>.
  <li>If there are any errors Java CUP will not (re-)generate the Java files for <i>CUPParser</i> and <i>CUPToken</i>.
  <li>You may get warnings like
    <pre>
      Warning: Terminal "ILLEGAL" was declared but never used
    </pre>
    which are OK unless you are expecting the terminal symbol to be used in your grammar (that is never the case for "ILLEGAL").
  <li>Common typos that lead to errors are
    <ul>
      <li>forgetting the ":}" at the end of a block of action code (e.g. just writing "}")
      <li>forgetting the ";" at the end of a production
    </ul>
    Using the CUP support syntax highlighting in IntelliJ can help you to find issues like this
    and other syntax issues in your CUP file but not syntax issues within the action code blocks.
  <li>After running Java CUP the generated <i>CUPParser.java</i> may have compiler errors
    because Java CUP just copies the action code blocks verbatim into <i>CUPParser</i>.
    There are comments in the generated <i>CUPParser</i> file indicating
    which production the action code is associated with.
    When you work out what is causing the problem, fix it in <i>PL0.cup</i> and rerun Java CUP. 
</ul>

<font color="red">
  The following are instructions to set up the <i>Run CUP</i> run script in IntelliJ.
  You should not need to use these.
<ul>
    <li>Run > Edit Configurations > Plus Button > Application
    <li>Give the configuration a name like "Run CUP"
    <li>Select the main class using the drop down and searching for java_cup.Main.
    <li>Put "-interface -locations -parser CUPParser -symbols CUPToken PL0.cup" into the program arguments
    <li>Select the src/parse directory as the working directory using the file browser
      (or append /src/parse to the end of the default path)
</ul>
</font>

<h4>Run JFlex</h4>

<ul>
  <li>This script runs JFlex on input file <i>PL0.flex</i> to generate the lexical analyser <i>Lexer.java</i>
  <li>It links to the <i>CUPToken</i> class generated by JavaCUP.
  <li>The terminal symbols (lexical tokens) defined in <i>PL0.flex</i> must match the terminal symbols defined in <i>PL0.cup</i> in its "terminals" section.
  <li>Any additions to the terminal symbols require both <i>PL0.flex</i> and <i>PL0.cup</i> to be updated
    and both Java CUP and JFlex rerun.
</ul>

<font color="red">
  The following are instructions to set up the <i>Run CUP</i> run script in IntelliJ.
  You should not need to use these.
<ul>
    <li>Under the left column > Plus Button > Application
    <li>Give the configuration a name like "Run JFlex"
    <li>Select the main class using the drop down and searching for jflex.Main.
    <li>Put PL0.flex into the program arguments
    <li>Select the src/parse directory as the working directory using the file browser
      (or append /src/parse to the end of the default path)
    <li>Under 'Before launch' > Plus Button > Run Another Configuration > Compile CUP
      (or the name used for the previous configuration)
</ul>
</font>
</font>

<font color="blue">
<h3>Tracing generated code</h3>

In the tracing
<ul>
  <li>PC stands for "Program Counter", i.e. the location of the instruction being executed
  <li>FP stands for "Frame Pointer", 0 for the main program but non-zero for procedures called directly
    or indirectly from the main program (this isn't all that relevant for assignment 1)
  <li>  SP stands for "Stack Pointer"; a push increases it and a pop decreases it;
    it starts at 3 and should never get below 3
  <li>Opcode gives the instruction being executed
  <li>All pops and pushes on the stack are traced giving the values pushed and popped
  <li>Store [3] <= 100 means 100 is stored at location 3
  <li>Load [3] => 100 means 100 was loaded from location 3 (it then gets pushed onto the stack)
  <li>Branch => 1017 means branch to location 1017, i.e. set the PC to 1017
</ul>
The tricky (and common) errors are when you get the branch offset out and branch to
a different instruction to what you expected.
That can lead to weird behaviour including stack under/over flows, etc.
If you branch into the second word of a LOADCON, it may not even be a valid opcode for an instruction.
</font>

<h2>Using Eclipse (not preferred)</h2>

If you are using Eclipse then it will automatically compile the Java
source files.
<font color="blue">
For the compiler generated via Java-CUP (assignments 2 and 3):
<ul>
  <li>to run the Java-CUP parser generator to rebuild CUPParser.java and
  CUPTokens.java from PL0.cup run the ant script <i>build-cup.xml</i>
  from within Eclipse
  <ul>
    <li>Select <i>build-cup.xml</i> and right click
    <li>Select Run As > Ant Build
    <li>The output from JavaCup appears in the Console window
    <li>Be sure to check any for any JavaCUP errors,
      as it will not generate the Java parser CUPParser.java if there are any
    <li>JavaCUP warnings of the form "Warning : Terminal "ILLEGAL" was declared but never used" are OK
  </ul>
  <li>you also need to refresh the parser files after running the ant
  script, but you can set up Eclipse to do this automatically as part
  of running the ant script</li>
  <li>to run the JFlex lexical analyser generator to build Lexer.java from
  PL0.flex run the ant script <i>build-flex.xml</i> from within
  Eclipse, and refresh the parser files; you should only need to
  generate Lexer.java once.
</ul>
</font>

<h3>Running the PL0 compiler under Eclipse</h3>

You'll need to set up a run configuration to run the PL0 compiler
under Eclipse.
While in the assignment compiler Eclipse project that you have
imported. 
<ul>
 <li>Select Run>Run Configurations...
 <li>Select Java Application
 <li>Press the new icon (the box with the "+" in the corner)
 <li>Give your new configuration a name (like "A1run")
 <li>The Project field should correspond to the compiler project (eg,
  "T4", "A1")
 <li>Under the "Main" tab, press "search" under "Main class"
 <li>Select PL0_RD (for recursive descent) or 
    <font color="blue">PL0_LALR (for Java-CUP version)</font> from package pl0
 <li>Select the "Arguments" tab
 <li>Insert in text box 
     <ul>
       -v "${resource_loc}"
     </ul>
     These are the arguments to the PL0 compiler, which are described
     in more detail below. 
     If the path name to your workspace includes blanks,
     don't forget to put the quotes around ${resource_loc}.
     In Eclipse ${resource_loc} is replaced by the currently selected file. 
     Hence to compile a PL0 program, 
     you should first select the PL0 program,
     e.g., select "test-pgm/test-based-write1.pl0" 
     (which is the closest PL0 gets to a "Hello World" program)
     under Eclipse, and then select "Run>Run" to run the run
     configuration that you previously ran, or "Run>Run
     Configurations..." to switch to a different configuration, or
     create a new configuration.
</ul>

<h4>Running CUP and JFlex to build the parser and scanner Java source</h4>
<ul>
    <li>View > Tool Windows > Ant Build > Select the build.xml inside the project directory, also add (using Green +) the build-cup.xml and build-flex.xml
    <li>For all three ant build targets, Right click on it, Properties > Additional Classpath > Add > Select both the javacup and jflex jars
    <li>Open build.xml, build-flex.xml, build-cup.xml and add the following lines just after the first line (after the project name)<br/>
&lt;taskdef name="JFlexTask" classname="jflex.anttask.JFlexTask"/&gt;<br/>
&lt;taskdef name="CUPTask" classname="java_cup.anttask.CUPTask"/&gt;<br/>
I also modified the project name in build-cup.xml to PL0-Compiler-Cup and changed &lt;target name="build" depends="cup,jflex,compile"&gt; near the bottom of build.xml to &lt;target name="build" depends="cup,jflex"&gt;. This last change makes it so that build just calls cup and flex and leaves compiling to IntelliJ
    <li>PL0-Compiler > Right click "build" > Execute On > Before Compilation</li>

    <p>To test it out, try hit run. You should see that the Lexer.java file has changed on line 23 to use your path and not ian's file path</p>

    <p>NOTE: if this ever breaks weirdly for whatever reason, go to Build > Rebuild project and try again
    File > Settings > Plugins > Browse repositories > Cup Support & Grammar-Kit (.cup and .flex support)</p>
</ul>
</font>
-->

<!--
<p>
Within tests there is a Unix shell script <i>mkresult</i>,
which runs the PL0 compiler 
(you must have already compiled the compiler)
on a test file passed as an argument, e.g.,
within directory <i>tests</i> run
<ul>
  ./mkresult test-write1.pl0
</ul>
<p>
The <i>mkresult</i> shell script also saves copies of the
standard output produced by the compiler in
subdirectory <i>results</i> under the name 
<i>r-test-write1.pl0</i> and
the standard error output in subdirectory <i>errors</i> under the
name <i>e-test-write1.pl0</i>. 
<p>
The shell script <i>runtests</i> in the assignment directory will run
<mkresult</i> on every test program file within the subdirectory 
<i>test-pgm</i>.
A test program file must start with "test".
<p>
You should develop your own set of test cases to thoroughly test 
your compiler.
-->


<!--
<h4>Using Unix shell scripts</h4>

Within the assignment compiler directory there are a number of Unix shell
scripts to compile and run the PL0 compiler.
You can make (i.e., compile) the PL0 compiler using the Unix shell
script <i>compile</i>, i.e., run
<ul>
      ./compile
</ul>
The Java source code for the compiler is all in the
subdirectory <i>src</i>. 
See the the accompanying description of the source files.
<p>
The compilation process places the compiled class files in the
subdirectory build.
The main program is in package pl0 and file PL0.java.
<p>
There is also an ant script called <i>build.xml</i>.
