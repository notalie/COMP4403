<h1>PL0 Compiler Java Source Code (Recursive descent version)</h1>
<p>
The Java files that make up the compiler are listed below, along with a
brief description of their purpose. 
The source code for the compiler is divided into the following packages:
<ul>
  <li><b>pl0</b>
    contains the main program for the compiler
  </li>
  <li><b>parse</b>
    contains scanning and parsing as well as defining the lexical tokens
  </li>
  <li><b>tree</b>
    contains the abstract syntax tree and the static semantic checker
  </li>
  <li><b>syms</b>
    contains the symbol table, its entries, and type descriptors
  </li>
  <li><b>source</b>
    contains the source input and handling error messages
  </li>
  <li><b>interpreter</b>
    contains interpreting and executing an abstract syntax tree
  </li>
</ul>
 
 
<h2>Package pl0</h2>
<p>
You shouldn't need to look in here too much.
The main program defines some command line arguments that may be
useful. 
<ul>
  <li><b>PL0_RD.java</b>
    (class)
    The main program for the compiler 
    ("RD" stands for recursive descent).
  </li>
  <li><b>Runner.java</b>
    (abstract class)
    Defines common steps for compiling or interpreting a program.
  </li>
  <li><b>Test_RD.java</b>
    (class)
    The JUnit test class to test that the output of
    PL0 programs (in the test-pgm directory) matches expected output.
  </li>
  <li><b>TestRunner.java</b>
    (abstract class)
    Defines common test utilities used by Test_RD.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Package parse</h2>
<p>
You'll need to understand how the Parser works and what the lexical
Tokens are, but you shouldn't need to look at the Scanner.
<ul>
  <li><b>IdentifierToken.java</b> 
    (class, extends LexicalToken)
    Subclass of token for identifier tokens only.
  </li>
  <li><b>LexicalToken.java</b> 
    (class)
    Defines the lexical token passed between the scanner and parser.
  </li>
  <li><b>NumberToken.java</b>
    (class, extends LexicalToken)
    Subclass of token for integer number tokens only.
  </li>
  <li><b>Parser.java</b>
    (class)
    The parser recognises the input program and creates and
    abstract syntax tree and symbol table.
    This version uses a recursive descent parser.
  </li>
  <li><b>Scanner.java</b>
    (class)
    The scanner recognises the input character stream and splits
    it up into a stream of lexical tokens.
  </li>
  <li><b>Token.java</b>
    (class)
    Defines the lexical tokens.
  </li>
  <li><b>TokenSet.java</b>
    (class)
    Defines types and operations on sets of Tokens.
  </li>
  <li><b>TokenStream.java</b>
    (class)
    Handles access to the stream of tokens from input source from the
    parser. Contains generic syntax error recovery methods.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Package tree</h2>
<p>
You'll need to know the structure of the Abstract Syntax Tree and the
definitions of the Operators.
Then you'll need to understand how the StaticChecker works.
This implements the Visitor interfaces to traverse the abstract
syntax tree.
<ul>
  <li><b>ConstExp.java</b>
    (class)
    Symbolic constant expressions are evaluated at compile time.
    This class provides tree nodes to represent constant expressions
    and evaluate them.
  </li>
  <li><b>DeclNode.java</b>
    (class)
    This class provides the abstract syntax tree nodes representing
    declarations lists and procedure declarations.
  </li>
  <li><b>DeclVisitor.java</b>
    (interface)
    Visitor interface for declarations and procedures (including main program).
  </li>
  <li><b>ExpNode.java</b>
    (class)
    Defines the nodes in the abstract syntax tree for expressions
    as well as methods for allowing tree traversals using the visitor pattern.
  </li>
  <li><b>ExpTransform.java</b>
    (interface)
    Visitor interface for expressions returning a transformed expression.
  </li>
  <li><b>Operator.java</b>
    (enumeration)
    Enumeration for the binary and unary operators for the abstract syntax tree.
  </li>
  <li><b>StatementNode.java</b>
    (class)
    Defines the nodes in the abstract syntax tree for statements 
    as well as methods for allowing tree traversals using the visitor pattern.
    You'll need to modify this to generate the appropriate abstract
    syntax tree structure.
  </li>
  <li><b>StatementVisitor.java</b>
    (interface)
    Visitor interface for statements (used by static checker).
  </li>
  <li><b>StaticChecker.java</b>
    (class, implements TreeVisitor, ExpTransform, and StatementVisitor) 
    Implements the static (type) checking for the compiler via
    a tree traversal.
    You'll need to modify this to static check the new constructs.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Package syms</h2>
<p>
This package defines the symbol table and its entries as well as type descriptors.
<ul>
  <li><b>Predefined.java</b>
    (class)
    Handles all the predefined constants, types and operators.
  </li>
  <li><b>Scope.java</b>
    (class)
    Provides a single scope within the symbol table.
  </li>
  <li><b>SymbolTable.java</b>
    (class)
    The main symbol table that puts together symbol tables for
    each Scope (procedure, main program or predefined scope) that
    contain entries (SymEntry) for each identifier.
    Handles constant, variable, type, procedure identifiers, 
    as well as the type structures.
  </li>
  <li><b>SymbolTableTest.java</b>
    (JUnit test class)
    JUnit test for the symbol table.
  </li>
  <li><b>SymEntry.java</b>
    (class)
    Defines the symbol table entries for CONST, TYPE, VAR and 
    PROCEDURE identifiers, and operators.
  </li>
  <li><b>Type.java</b>
    (class)
    Defines the symbol table structures that represent types,
    including basic types like int and boolean, as well as 
    subrange types.
  </li>
  <li><b>TypeTest.java</b>
    (JUnit test class)
    JUnit test for types.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Package interpreter</h2>
<p>
  Interprets and executes an abstract syntax tree.
  Interpreter implements DeclVisitor and StatementVisitor
  from the tree package and ExpEvaluator to visit nodes in the abstract
  syntax tree.
  Frame is used to store variables in stack frames.
<ul>
  <li><b>Interpreter.java</b>
    (class, implements StatementVisitor, and ExpTransform)
    Implements code interpretation and execution by tree traversal of the
    abstract syntax tree.

  </li>
  <li><b>Value.java</b>
    (class)
    Representation of values in the run time stack; either integers or addresses at the moment.
</ul>

<h2>Package source</h2>

This is low level boring stuff.
You shouldn't have to look in here
unless you just want to find out what it does.
<ul>
  <li><b>CompileError.java</b>
    (class)
    Stores a single error message.
  </li>
  <li><b>VisitorDebugger.java</b>
    (class)

  <li><b>Severity.java</b>
    (enumeration)
    Enumeration containing the error message severities.
  </li>
  <li><b>Source.java</b>
    (class)
